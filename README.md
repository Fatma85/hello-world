Hi humans!!!

Fatma is here, I'm a beginner in Java.
This is my first time using GitHub.
I'm trying to learn more about it.
It's my second day using GitHub.
I'm trying to understand more about the structure and how it can be used properly.
I'm excited to learn more about it.
I hope I learn as soon as possible.
